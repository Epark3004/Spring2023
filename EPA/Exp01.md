# ðŸ’¦ Experiment 01: Assessing L2 accentedness

Here is a step-by-step guide to prepare a perception experiment using the ExperimentMFC object in Praat, where participants will rate 18 sentence stimuli on a scale of 1 (Heavily accented) to 6 (Native like):

## Pre-setting:

1. Create a folder named **workspace** directly under **C:/workspace/** > Create **Exp01** folder under that folder > Create **Sounds** folder under that folder
2. Download speech file (https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/tree/main/EPA)
3. Open Praat > read wav file > create a TextGrid file > Labelling > Extract audio by sentences > Save them under C:/workspace/Exp01/Sounds/
4. In Praat Object, create a new praat script > Copy and paste [this script](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/raw/main/EPA/exp01.txt) > Save it as Exp01.praat under C:/workspace/Exp01/
5. Understand the script (Exp01.praat)
6. In Praat, **Open > Read from file...** > Open **Exp01.praat** > **Run**
7. After finishing the experiment > Collect to table > Save the result file as 'a comma separated file' (This can be read as csv in excel.)

More to do: will be updated.

## Experiment design and research process

1. Create stimuli files: Record or obtain the 18 sentence stimuli as individual audio files (preferably in WAV format). Name them systematically, e.g., S01.wav, S02.wav, etc.

2. Organize stimuli: Create a folder named "Sounds" and place all the audio files within it. This folder will be used to store and organize the stimuli for the experiment.

3. Create a Praat script: (Exp01.praat)
  
4. Run the experiment: Open Praat, go to "Praat > Open Praat script", and select the script you created in step 5. Press "Run" to execute the script and start the experiment.

5. Collect data: Participants will listen to the sentences, rate them on the scale of 1 to 6.

6. Analyze and interpret the data: Once all participants have completed the experiment, analyze the data file using statistical methods to answer your research questions and draw conclusions about accent perception.
