There are several challenges in the field of pronunciation assessment, including:

Reliability and validity: There is a need for reliable and valid assessment methods and tools to accurately measure pronunciation skills.

Inter-rater reliability: It can be difficult to ensure consistency in scoring pronunciation assessments, as it often relies on human judgment.

Standardization: There is a lack of standardization in pronunciation assessment, making it difficult to compare scores and results across different assessments.

Native speaker bias: Assessments may be influenced by the assessor's native language and cultural background, leading to potential bias in scores and feedback.

Contextual factors: Pronunciation can vary depending on context and individual factors such as the learner's background, accent, and motivation. This makes it difficult to assess pronunciation accurately in a single assessment.

Limited resources: There may be a lack of resources and materials available for pronunciation assessment, including appropriate pronunciation models and assessment tools.
