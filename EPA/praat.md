**Praat** is a versatile, open-source software for phonetic analysis and synthesis, designed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink [Phonetic Sciences, University of Amsterdam](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/). It allows researchers, linguists, and educators to analyze, manipulate, and visualize speech sounds with a user-friendly interface. Praat offers tools for recording, labeling, and segmenting audio files, as well as extracting acoustic features such as pitch, formants, and intensity. Users can generate spectrograms, manipulate pitch contours, and create synthetic speech. Praat supports scripting for advanced analysis and automation, making it a popular choice for investigating linguistic questions and exploring the complexities of human speech.
