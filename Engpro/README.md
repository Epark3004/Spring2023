Undergraduate (3 Credits)

## Course Overview

This course aims to help students understand key principles of English pronunciation, develop the ability to articulate English sounds correctly, and improve their pronunciation. It's intended for second language learners and native speakers with accents. The course emphasizes that having an accent is not a critical problem as long as pronunciation is acceptable and intelligible. The main goal is to learn and practice English sounds, including consonants and vowels, and how they differ from sounds in the student's native language. To simplify learning, important sound rules and principles of English pronunciation will also be taught. Through participatory activities, students will sharpen their speaking and listening proficiency. They will be exposed to a variety of authentic materials, including TED talks and online videos, to analyze and practice their comprehension and speaking skills. Furthermore, students will use digital resources and AI technologies to enhance their learning experience. Upon completion of the course, students will possess a comprehensive foundation in English pronunciation, equipping them with the skills necessary to become confident and competent English teachers in the 21st century.
