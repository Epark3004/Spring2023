# Self-Test: Strings and Integers

+ Objective: This self-test lesson aims to help you practice your understanding of strings and integers in Python, using the Google Colab platform.

## Step 1: Open a new Colab notebook

1. Go to Google Colab.
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click on File > New notebook.

## Step 2: Write a brief description of strings and integers

Before we start the exercises, let's briefly recall what strings and integers are.

+ Strings: A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Examples: "Hello, world!" or 'Python is great!'
+ Integers: Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without any decimal points. Examples: 42, -5, 0

Now that we have refreshed our memory, let's move on to the exercises!

# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Create a string and an integer

Create a string named greeting that contains the value "Hello, students!" and an integer named year that contains the value 2023.

```
# Write your code here
```
## Exercise 2: Print the string and integer
Print the string greeting and the integer year using the print() function.

```
# Write your code here
```
## Exercise 3: Concatenate the string and integer
Use string concatenation to create a new string named message by combining the greeting string and the year integer. Make sure to add a space between them. Then, print the message.

_Hint: You'll need to convert the integer to a string using the str() function._

```
# Write your code here
```
## Exercise 4: Perform arithmetic operations with integers

Create two integers named num1 and num2 with the values 10 and 3, respectively. Perform the following arithmetic operations and print the results:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division (floating-point result)
Integer division (quotient)
Modulus (remainder)

```
# Write your code here
```
## Exercise 5: Input string and integer from user
Prompt the user for a string called user_string and an integer called user_number. Then, print the user_string repeated user_number times.

_Hint: You'll need to use the input() function and convert the input to an integer using the int() function._
```
# Write your code here
```

Congratulations! You have completed the self-test lesson on strings and integers. If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to ask your teacher.
