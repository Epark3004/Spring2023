# (4/19) Self-Test: Strings and Integers

+ Objective: This self-test lesson aims to help you practice your understanding of strings and integers in Python, using the Google Colab platform.

**ðŸ“ŒNote: Individuals in each group should create his/her own file (python notebook ending with .ipynb) and save it in his/her own repository:**  
e.g., DL2023/DL/DLW07B_KMR.ipynb (KMR should be your initials of the name)


## Step 1: Open a new Colab notebook

1. Go to Google Colab.
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click on File > New notebook.

## Step 2: Write a brief description of strings and integers in a text cell

Before we start the exercises, let's briefly recall what strings and integers are.

+ Strings: A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Examples: "Hello, world!" or 'Python is great!'
+ Integers: Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without any decimal points. Examples: 42, -5, 0

Now that we have refreshed our memory, let's move on to the exercises!

# ðŸ’¦Exercises

## ðŸ“™Exercise 1: Create a string and an integer

Create a string named greeting that contains the value "Hello, students!" and an integer named year that contains the value 2023.

```
# Write your code here
```
## ðŸ“™Exercise 2: Print the string and integer
Print the string greeting and the integer year using the print() function.

```
# Write your code here
```
## ðŸ“™Exercise 3: Concatenate the string and integer
Use string concatenation to create a new string named message by combining the greeting string and the year integer. Make sure to add a space between them. Then, print the message.

_Hint: You'll need to convert the integer to a string using the str() function._

```
# Write your code here
```
## ðŸ“™Exercise 4: Perform arithmetic operations with integers

Create two integers named num1 and num2 with the values 10 and 3, respectively. Perform the following arithmetic operations and print the results:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division (floating-point result)
Integer division (quotient)
Modulus (remainder)

```
# Write your code here
```
## ðŸ“™Exercise 5: Input string and integer from user
Prompt the user for a string called user_string and an integer called user_number. Then, print the user_string repeated user_number times.

_Hint: You'll need to use the input() function and convert the input to an integer using the int() function._
```
# Write your code here
```

## ðŸ“™Exercise 6: Splitting a string
Given a string sentence, split it into words and store the result in a list named words_list. Then, print the list.
```
sentence = "Coding is fun and easy to learn!"

# Write your code here
```
## ðŸ“™Exercise 7: Converting strings to uppercase and lowercase
Create a string text containing the value "Coding is Exciting!". Convert the string to uppercase and store it in a variable named uppercase_text. Convert the string to lowercase and store it in a variable named lowercase_text. Finally, print both uppercase_text and lowercase_text.

```
# Write your code here
```
## ðŸ“™Exercise 8:  String indexing and slicing
Given a string quote, perform the following tasks:

1. Print the first character of the string.
2. Print the last character of the string.
3. Print the first 5 characters of the string.
4. Print the characters from position 5 to the end of the string.
5. Print the entire string in reverse order.

```
quote = "To be or not to be, that is the question."

# Write your code here
```
Congratulations! You have completed the self-test lesson on strings and integers. If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to ask your teacher.
