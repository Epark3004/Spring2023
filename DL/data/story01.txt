Collie and Sea Otter were best friends who loved to explore the world together. One day, they decided to visit the beautiful rainbow beach. When they arrived, they were amazed by the colourful sand and crystal clear water. Sea Otter couldn't resist jumping into the water, while Collie preferred to dig in the sand. Suddenly, Collie uncovered a shiny and colourful seashell. She was so excited that she ran to show Sea Otter. As they admired the beautiful shell, they noticed the colours reflecting onto their faces. They smiled at each other, knowing that they had discovered a treasure worth more than gold.
