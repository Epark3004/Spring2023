# ðŸŒ± Digital Literacy and English Education (Spring 2023)

: Undergraduate course (2 Credits), 4-6pm Tuesdays.

## ðŸŒ€ Course Overview

This undergraduate course aims to introduce students to the concept of digital literacy and its importance as a future language teacher. Digital literacy skills are increasingly crucial for language teachers in the 21st century and here are some reasons why:

- Firstly, effective learning materials are often found online and require teachers to be able to use digital tools and platforms to access, evaluate, and utilize them.  
- Secondly, AI technology is rapidly being integrated into language classes, and teachers need to be able to use these tools to facilitate learning and provide personalized feedback to students. 
- Finally, students at different proficiency levels may require different types of activities, and digital literacy skills can help teachers to design and deliver these effectively.

The ability to use digital tools and platforms is essential for language teachers in the digital age. It allows them to provide their students with the most up-to-date and engaging learning materials, and to utilize the full range of technological resources available to facilitate language learning. This course will provide students with the fundamental and necessary digital literacy skills to succeed as English teachers, and help them to be confident and effective in the digital classroom. 

By the end of this course, students will have a strong foundation in digital literacy and be well-prepared to utilize digital tools and technologies to enhance their teaching practice and facilitate the language learning of their students.
